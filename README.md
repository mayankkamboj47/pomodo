# Pomodo

Pomodo is a todo list cum pomodoro timer.

# Starting locally

The repo doesn't depend on any servers - the browser has the source code for the entire app instead of just
a hollow UI. There is no backend.

To start the app locally, clone the repo, and run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`. This will start the app.

If you use yarn :

    
    yarn install
    yarn dev
    

And for pnpm :

     
     pnpm install
     pnpm dev
